# Computer Graphics Implementation
- The following files implementated and fully tested the basic computer graphics 
- Including CMU 15-462/662 Assignments in 2015Fall (http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015/)

## 1. A Mini-SVG Renderer 
[See more detail here!](https://github.com/junanita/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/1.%20A%20Mini-SVG%20Renderer%20)
- Implemented a simple software rasterizer that draws points, lines, triangles, bitmap images.
- A viewer that supports the basic features of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format that is now widely used on the internet.
- Including: <br/>
-- <strong>Supersampling</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Transformation</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Texture Mapping</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Bilinear Filtering</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Trilinear Filtering</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Mipmap</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Occlusion</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Alpha Compositing</strong> <br/>



## 2. A Mini Mesh Editor
[See more detail here!](https://github.com/junanita/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/2.%20A%20Mini%20Mesh%20editor%20)
- Implemented a simple mesh editor to manipulate and resample triangle meshes
- Developed a tool to load and edit COLLADA mesh files used by major modeling packages and graphics engines
- Including: <br/>
-- <strong>Upsampling</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Downsampling</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Resampling</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Edge Flip</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Edge Collapse</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>Edge Split</strong> <br/>


## 4. An Animation Editor 
[See more detail here!](https://github.com/junanita/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/4.%20An%20Animation%20Editor)
- Implement an application that allows to manipulate and animate jointed cartoon characters
- Developed a tool that can produce animations using three of the major techniques in production computer animation: keyframing, numerical optimization, and physically-based simulation.
- Including: <br/>
-- <strong>keyframing</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>numerical optimization</strong> <br/>
-- <strong>physically-based simulation</strong> <br/>
